# V-RALLY: decompdecomp progress

This is a saved decompilation project created with [decompdecomp](https://github.com/n-delic/decompdecomp).
AI agents were used during the decompilation; their C attempts were kept only when decompdecomp's byte-for-byte
judge accepted them as matches.

## Project details

- **Game:** V-RALLY
- **Platform:** n64
- **Compiler:** gcc-2.7.2-kmc
<!-- decompdecomp:progress:start -->
- **Progress:** 2079 matching function(s), 30 best attempt(s)
- **Completion:** 2,079 / 2,093 functions (99.3%). 28 set aside, excluded from completion.

## What's in this folder

This folder is the whole of the work, and the only part of the project to share or keep in git. It holds no game
data: everything else in the project's folder was made from the game (the ROM, `asm/`, `assets/`, the build files)
and stays on your computer.

```
src/<function>.c      each matched function's C, byte for byte
best/<function>.c     the closest attempt so far at each function that doesn't match yet
include/common.h      the shared header every function is compiled with (common_<part>.h: a part's own)
decompdecomp.json     the game's fingerprint (its SHA-1, never the game), the compiler and its flags, the
                      functions' layout and names, notes, instructions, what agents learned, who matched what
README.md             this file
```

## Continue on another computer

Open decompdecomp, choose **New project → Open a saved project**, then pick this folder (or paste its git
repository's address) and your own copy of the game. decompdecomp checks it's the same game and judges every saved
function again: a match counts because it matches, not because a file says so.

## Progress map

![Decompilation completion and function map](decompdecomp-progress.svg)

Green: matched. Gold: attempted. Grey: open. Red: set aside. Functions follow address, then source unit and name order.
The image and tagged counts update on save. Keep project notes outside the hidden `decompdecomp` comment pairs to preserve them.
